### About
This repo contains the official implementation of the [Aligning Latent and Image Spaces to Connect the Unconnectable](https://arxiv.org/todo) paper.

### Installation
To install, run the following command:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix ./env
conda activate ./env
```

Note: the tensorboard requirement is crucial, because otherwise upfirdn2d will not compile for some magical reason.

### Training
To train the model, navigate to the project directory and run:
```
python infra/launch_local.py hydra.run.dir=. +experiment_name=my_experiment_name +dataset=dataset_name num_gpus=4
```
where `dataset_name` is the name of the dataset without `.zip` extension inside `data/` directory (you can easily override the paths in `configs/main.yml`).
So make sure that `data/dataset_name.zip` exists and should be a plain directory of images.
See [StyleGAN2-ADA](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch) repo for additional data format details.
This training command will create an experiment inside `experiments/` directory and will copy the project files into it.
This is needed to isolate the code which produces the model.


### Inference
The inference example can be found in [notebooks/generate.ipynb](notebooks/generate.ipynb)

### Data format
We use the same data format as the original [StyleGAN2-ADA](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch) repo: it is a zip of images.
It is assumed that all data is located in a single directory, specified in `configs/main.yml`.
Put your datasets as zip archives into `data/` directory.


### Pretrained checkpoints
We provide checkpoints for the following datasets:
- [LHQ 1024x1024](https://vision-cair.s3.amazonaws.com/alis/lhq1024-snapshot.pkl) with FID = 7.8. Note: this checkpoint has patch size of 1024x512, i.e. the image is generated in just 2 halves.

### License
